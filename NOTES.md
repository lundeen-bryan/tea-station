# Course Notes

A list of research notes for the current project. May or maynot end up finding all the answers, but in the process of asking questions, I intend to become a better developer. Before implementing this approach, I had a hard time establishing a deep understanding of concepts that I was taught in tutorials and university coursework. Essentially, I needed to grasp these concepts more fully before moving forward because I would often get to a higher-level concept that required full-comprehension of earlier concepts. It is like building a house on top of a foundation that wasn't very solid, as soon as a storm comes the house falls down. So to encourage myself to fully grasp the concepts, I implemented this note taking template that can go with each project. Outside of coursework, it might also help to write better design documentation in the software development process by creating an FAQ about the project. 

### Table of Contents
