# Course Notes

A list of research notes for the current project. May or maynot end up finding all the answers, but in the process of asking questions, I intend to become a better developer. Before implementing this approach, I had a hard time establishing a deep understanding of concepts that I was taught in tutorials and university coursework. Essentially, I needed to grasp these concepts more fully before moving forward because I would often get to a higher-level concept that required full-comprehension of earlier concepts. It is like building a house on top of a foundation that wasn't very solid, as soon as a storm comes the house falls down. So to encourage myself to fully grasp the concepts, I implemented this note taking template that can go with each project. Outside of coursework, it might also help to write better design documentation in the software development process by creating an FAQ about the project.

## Notes with Video Section or Timestamp

- Footer with fontawesome icons, text, copywrite, etc.
- Font Awesome will not show icons if the browser has adblock running. 
- The app.js file inserts the current year. It must be in the right sequence of sections to work. 
- Hamburger menu style button that floats as the page is scrolled. Used a z-index to keep it above other pictures so that it floats.
- Added hamberger menu style button to navbar
- started some of the structure for navhtml
- started some of the structure for navhtml
- §184 only show the navbar when the hamburermenu is clicked
- hide the navbar by using transform: translateX(-100%) so that the bar is taken off the screen and will only show later when it's being used. In the .showNav class we can manipulate the navbar to show. By default in .navbar it is hidden using tranlateX. all the classes have to be exactly the same as Johns or the javascript file will not work right. 
- §Annimation for toggle button fly-in animation
- Form submission phase
